**Employee Demographics and Pay Structure Analysis (Power BI)**

**Overview**

This project analyzes an organization‚Äôs employee data with a focus on gender-related insights, salary distribution, and performance-based bonus allocation. Using Power BI, I developed an interactive dashboard that provides management with actionable insights into workforce diversity, pay equity, and regulatory compliance.

The analysis supports strategic HR and finance decisions ‚Äî from identifying pay gaps to ensuring compliance with a new minimum wage policy.

Objectives / Key Questions

What is the gender distribution across the organization, regions, and departments?

Are there differences in performance ratings based on gender?

How is the salary structure distributed, and is there evidence of a gender pay gap?

Does the organization comply with the new minimum salary regulation of $90,000?

How many employees fall into specific salary bands ($10k‚Äì$20k, $20k‚Äì$30k, etc.) ‚Äî by region?

How should annual bonus payments be allocated based on performance ratings?

What is the total payout (salary + bonus) per employee, region, and company-wide?
